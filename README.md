## Background

Hong Kong Leisure and Cultural Services Department's website is horrifyingly outdated both in technological and modern human-computer interaction perspective. As a result, users are prompted with numours unnecessary questions throughout the system. As we can't expect a government organization to improve their system radically, let's try to help ourself a little bit!
